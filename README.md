# An efficient object detection technique for autonomous vehicles using advanced GAN model

# Overview
This project, developed for CSE463 (Computer Vision: Fundamentals and Algorithms) group project, presents an innovative approach to autonomous vehicle object detection through the integration of advanced generative adversarial networks (GAN) and real-time detection systems. This enhances autonomous vehicle reliability by training detection systems for extreme weather conditions.
# Core Components
### 1. Advanced GAN Implementation (Pix2Pix)


- Generates realistic adverse weather conditions:

- Heavy snow scenarios
- Rain and fog variations
- Low visibility conditions


### 2. Weather-Aware Object Detection (YOLOv5)

  - Enhanced detection in challenging weather scenarios
  - Maintains accuracy during snow, rain, and fog. 

# System Requirements
Prerequisites
Development environment requirements:

 - Python 3.x
